h1. About

This project contains a converter, which can transform Java property files used for localizations into Titanium Appcelerator XML files.

This is useful, if you use other tools than a simple text editor for maintaining your localizations, for instance Pootle or Weblate.

Download the latest version from https://github.com/downloads/Communote/Converter-Properties-To-Titanium-XML/converter-0.2.jar

h1. Usage

# Create *strings.locale* files instead of *strings.xml* within your Titanium projects. We used _locale_ as extension, because of some UTF-8 problems. Simple treat them as they were Java properties.
# Edit your localization in the strings.locale files
# Configure Titanium Studio to use the converter as an additional builder:
## Open the projects settings and navigate to builders
## Add a new builder "LanguageConverter" and configure it like this
### *Location*: Path to your Java executable, i.e. /usr/bin/java
### *Working Directory*: ${build_project}
### *Arguments*: "-jar /path/to/converter.jar"
### _Optional_: Configure "Build Options" for your needs, for instance to let it only run on build and clean.
## Move the builder to the top of the list of builders
